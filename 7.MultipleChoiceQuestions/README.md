# Multiple Choice Questions

## Goal
To create an application asking multiple choice questions concerning JavaScript to a user. Once user answered all questions, his/her score is displayed on screen plus a list of the question he/she didn't answered correctly.

## Thoughts
- Datas related questions should be put inside a .json file.
- JSON file should be parsed into a JavaScript object.
