# Palindrome Checker

## Goals

To build a vanilla JavaScript application taking a user input and checking if that input is indeed a palindrome, that is to say 'a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards' (e.g. madam).

### To Do
    - Through JavaScript, create a paragraph element to nest inside the output of the function.
    - Style the paragraph with a different color depending of the input being a palindrome or not.

### Done
    - Create an index.html file with a heading, a figure for the palindrome definition (for those who doesn't know what it means), a label/input text element and one button to send the data. Also a footer with name and year.
    - Add a note to warn users that punctuation, capitalization and spaces are ignored.
    - Add a button and logic to randomly generate a true palindrome (for those who are curious, lazy or didn't quite get the meaning of the word)
    - Prevent the form from being sent when the user clicks on the form's button
    - A function that takes the user's input, convert it into an array, create an other array based on the first but with all elements reversed then check if the arrays content match and return the result.
