# Color Flipper

## Goals
**Building a vanilla JavaScript application to randomly change the background color of a web page.**

This is the first project of my '100 days of code' challenge. For this challenge, i want to focus less on tutorials and more on actual projects where i'm not guided and have to think / find solutions by myself. Didn't want to set the bar too high for my first day so i picked a project that seems manageable with a language i'm familiar with.

### To Do
- Solve a problem where the span text content is sometimes equal to 'undefined' (use console.log())
- Define a default background color
- Properly style the whole application

### Done
- Access the body / button element through querySelector()
- Listen to the button 'click' event and change the body's background color in reaction
- Found a GitHub repo with all css named colors (plus their hex values) packed in an object 
- Create two functions: one to randomly generate an integer between a minimum and maximum value, the other to randomly generate one of the 148th css named color's name
- Access the span element nested inside the heading element and changed its rendered text into the name of the new background color
