# Counter

## Goals
**Building a vanilla JavaScript Application to dynamically increase, decrease or reset a counter.**

### To Do
    - Style the document, make it so the number is a particular color if even and another if odd. (CANCELLED)

### Done
    - Create a heading, a paragraph for the counter and a div with three buttons nested inside.
    - Create a counter variable with a default value of 0 and set the paragraph's text content to this value.
    - Create three separate functions to handle the different operations (add, substract and reset)
    - Listen to 'click' event for each buttons and call the appropriate function depending of the selected action.
    - Add a footer in the html file with your name and the year 
    - Change the paragraph into another button.
    - Style the decrease / increase buttons so that they look like minus/plus operators
    - Make the minus/plus operators surround the count
