## What was learned
    - AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It's a sum of technologies which one can use to:
        1) receive and work with data from a server through the XMLHttpRequest Object.
        2) communicate with a server, exchange data and update the page without refreshing it.

    - Basic steps for using XMLHttpRequest:
        1) Assigns to the **onreadystatechange** property a function that will handle the response.
        2) Define and send the request using **open()** and **send()** methods.
        3) Check the request'state using the **requestState** property
        4) Check the response's status using the **status** property
        5) Do whatever you want with the response'data.
