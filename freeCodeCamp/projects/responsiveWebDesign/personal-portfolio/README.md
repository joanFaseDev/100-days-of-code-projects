# Personal Portfolio

## About

This project is the last one required by freeCodeCamp to validate their responsive web design curriculum. The task is to produce a web page, using only HTML and CSS, which serves as a portfolio.
There is few requirements for this project, the goal seems to be for the developer to use all he/she learned during the curriculum to create a responsive, accessible and 'as good looking as possible' portfolio.
