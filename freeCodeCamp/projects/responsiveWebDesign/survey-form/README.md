# Survey Form

## About

I create this project to practice what I learned this week from the freeCodeCamp's curriculum on responsive web design. The goal here is to modify a survey I did a couple of days ago to make it responsive and more accessible using CSS at-rules, media queries, and meta tags. I'll also try better organize my CSS rules to prevent code duplication.

On this particular project, I'm gonna use mobile-first design which means I'll first build the layout and feature for a mobile's user then extends them to a desktop's one. I'm also including the Open Color API to test various color choices for the page's design.
