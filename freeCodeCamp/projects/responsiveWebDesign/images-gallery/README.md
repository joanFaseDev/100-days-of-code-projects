# Images Gallery

## About

This project is basically a clone of the images gallery course on the responsive web design cursus of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The goal here is to practice what i learned during the course by building a responsive images gallery using only HTML & CSS. I'll also implement the basics of accessibility i learned since i did this course.
