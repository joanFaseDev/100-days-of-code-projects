# Product Landing Page

## About

This is a certification project for the Responsive Web Design curriculum on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The goal here is to build a fake product landing page while respecting some predefined user stories. This project is an opportunity to practice what was learned these last few days (CSS Grid, gradients, accessibility, using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/),...) with some measure of freedom, the subject being free.
I chose a fake game engine named Gaminit as a subject for this project. Most of the content displayed on the page was generated through [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) which is, in my opinion, a great tool to generate placeholder texts. That way, I can better focus on what actually matters, which is learning web development by practicing responsiveness, semantic tags, layouts, etc,...

## To Do

[X] Set up CSS basic rules (margin, box-sizing, etc,...)
[X] Choose fonts and colors for the page's design.
[X] Create a fake logo image on Figma.
[] Create a responsive hamburger navbar using only HTML and CSS.
