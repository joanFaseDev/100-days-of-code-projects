# Technical Documentation Page

## About

This project is part of freeCodeCamp curriculum focused on responsive web design. The goal here is to create fictional technical documentation. The subject is free but there is a list of conditions to respect (some HTML elements must be present, accessibility must be observed, media queries must be used, ...). I chose the game engine Construct 3 as the subject of the documentation, it seems a good choice considering the fact that I'm currently learning it.
I want to focus on layout, responsiveness, and accessibility so I used ChatGPT to generate the content (information on Construct 3). I didn't check the information, it's only here as a placeholder of sorts and what I will focus on isn't the content but the building of the page and the respect of modern web standards.
