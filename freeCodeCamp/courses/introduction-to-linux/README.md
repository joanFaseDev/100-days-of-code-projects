# Introduction to Linux

The content of this file is based on the "Introduction to Linux" course produced by freeCodeCamp. I wrote it a few days after switching my operating system, from Windows 10 to Ubuntu. The goal is to acquire the basics of Linux, more specifically the Ubuntu distribution. Along the way, I also tried to pick up some basic knowledge of computer science. What follows is thought as a summary of what I learned during the course and deemed important.

## What exactly is a distribution? And what does it have to do with Ubuntu?

A distribution or "distro" is, in the context of Linux, a complete operating system package that consists of the Linux kernel (a core component of all Linux operating systems) and a collection of software applications, libraries, configuration files, and other tools designed to target a specific audience with specific goals in mind.
Ubuntu for example comes from the Debian[^1] distribution and has a strong focus on stability. That is why it can be used on both desktop and server computers.

More generally, a distribution is a cohesive collection of tools (softwares, packages,...) gathered to be used quickly with a specific goal in mind.

## What is APT?

APT[^2] is a packages manager software use to easily search, install, configure, update and uninstall softwares on Debian, and Debian-based Linux distributions.

[^1]: Debian provides by far the largest and most complete software repository to its users of any Linux Distribution which is also the case for Ubuntu since it gets most of its packages from Debian's stable branch.
