# Countdown

## What did i learn?

- JavaScript Date object represent the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since **January 1, 1970 (UTC) at 00:00:00**.
- January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 is known as **POSIX time** / **Unix Epoch**. Unix engineers arbitrarily choose this date because it was convenient.
- JavaScript Date object doesn't have any properties.

## Steps
- Set a end date with a valid format
- Put an anchor (github repertories page) in footer
- Style desktop mode (countdown too small)
